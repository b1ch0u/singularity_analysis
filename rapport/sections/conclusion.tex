\chapter{Conclusion}

\section*{Acknowledgement}

I wish to express here my gratitude towards Marc Mezzarobba for his trust and availability. This internship was only carried out to a term thanks to his constant attention and availability.

In a time of great uncertainty about my future, and despite the challenges of an entirely remote internship, it was always a pleasure to work under his benevolent guidance.
