\section{Some differential equations theory}

In this section, we will present the results that enable one study a differential equation of the form \eqref{basic_eq_diff}.

\subsection{Scalar and system equations}

\paragraph{Differential equations}

The equation
\begin{equation}\label{scalar_eq}
	y^{(r)} = a_{r - 1}(z) y^{(r - 1)} + \dots + a_0(r) y
\end{equation}
where the $a_i$ are holomorphic is said to be a \emph{scalar} (differential) equation.

\paragraph{Differential systems}

The equation
\begin{equation}\label{system_eq}
	Y' = A(z) Y
\end{equation}
where $A(z)$ is an $n \times n$ matrix and $Y(z)$ is an $n$-dimensional vector
is said to be a (differential) \emph{system of equations}.

\paragraph{From scalar to system}

The following transformation is a classical trick to transform a scalar equation into a system:

If $y$ is a solution to 
\begin{equation*}\label{scalar_eqn}
	y^{(r)}(z) = a_{r - 1}(z) y^{(r - 1)}(z) + \dots + a_0(z) y(z)
\end{equation*}
then
$Y : z \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
y(z)\\
y'(z)\\
\vdots \\
y^{(n - 1)}(z)
\end{pmatrix}$
is a solution to
\begin{equation*}
	Y' = A(z)Y'(z)
\end{equation*} where
\begin{equation*}
A(z)=
\begin{pmatrix}
0&1&&&\\
 &0&1&\mbox{\Huge 0}\\
 \mbox{\Huge 0}& &\ddots & 1\\
a_0(z) & & \dots & a_{r - 1}(z)
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
We call $A$ the \emph{companion matrix} of equation \eqref{scalar_eqn}.

\subsection{Solutions space}

\paragraph{Basis of solutions}

The following classical theorem is admitted.

\begin{thm}{Cauchy's existence and uniqueness theorem}\label{thm_cauchy}
	Let $n$ an integer. Let also $A(z)$ an $n \times n$-matrix and $f(z)$ an $n$-dimensional vector, both holomorphic in some simply connected region $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$.
	
	Then, for any $z_0 \in \Omega$ and $y_0 \in \mathbb{C}^n$, the equation
	\begin{equation}\label{inhom_system_eq}
	Y' = A(z) Y
	\end{equation}
	has a unique solution such that
	\begin{equation*}
		y(z_0) = y_0
	\end{equation*}
	
	That solution is holomorphic on $\Omega$.
\end{thm}

It immediately follows

\begin{cor}{Basis of solutions for systems}
	Let $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$. Suppose there exists a neighbourhood $\Omega$ of $z_0$ such that $A$ and $f$ are holomorphic on $\Omega$.
	
	Then the set of solutions to equation \eqref{inhom_system_eq} defined in $z_0$ forms an $n$-dimensional vector space. 
\end{cor}
