abstract = {Analytic Combinatorics is a self-contained treatment of the mathematics underlying the analysis of discrete structures, which has emerged over the past several decades as an essential tool in the understanding of properties of computer programs and scientific models with applications in physics, biology and chemistry. Thorough treatment of a large number of classical applications is an essential aspect of the presentation. Written by the leaders in the field of analytic combinatorics, this text is certain to become the definitive reference on the topic. The text is complemented with exercises, examples, appendices and notes to aid understanding therefore, it can be used as the basis for an advanced undergraduate or a graduate course on the subject, or for self-study.},

	abstract = {This work presents a class of methods by which one can translate, on a term-by-term basis, an asymptotic expansion of a function around a dominant singularity into a corresponding asymptotic expansion for the Taylor coefficients of the function. This approach is based on contour integration using Cauchy's formula and Hankel-like contours. It constitutes an alternative to either Darboux's method or Tauberian theorems that appears to be well suited to combinatorial enumerations, and a few applications in this area are outlined.},
